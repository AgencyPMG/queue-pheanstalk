A driver for [pmg/queue](https://github.com/AgencyPMG/Queue) backed by 
[Pheanstalk](https://github.com/pda/pheanstalk) and [Beanstalkd](http://kr.github.io/beanstalkd/).

See the [pmg/queue readme](https://github.com/AgencyPMG/Queue/blob/master/README.md)
for the documentation of how the queue system as a whole works.

See the [examples](https://github.com/AgencyPMG/queue-pheanstalk/tree/master/examples)
